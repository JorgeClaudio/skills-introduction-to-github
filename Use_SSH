If you don't know how to create a SSH key for you, sit into a confy chair and do this:


OBS: I'm currently using Ubuntu, so please if you're in Windows, I'll share a new version later!


Open a terminal or  press >> CRTL + ALT + T

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-github-email@emaildomain.com"

It will prompt you for a name for the file. I like to use "main" but you can do whatever name you like! It's your key afterall.  

Now just start you ssh-agent with: 
    eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

It will prompt you with the process id and you're "probably" good to go. 

If you have any issues, call me. I want to help <3


Good Luck.
